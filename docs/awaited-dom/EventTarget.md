<div class='overview'><strong><code>EventTarget</code></strong> is a DOM interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.</div>

<div class='overview'><code>Element</code>, <code>Document</code>, and <code>Window</code> are the most common event targets, but other objects can be event targets too, for example <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, <code>AudioNode</code>, <code>AudioContext</code>, and others.</div>
